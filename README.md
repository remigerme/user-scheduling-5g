## How to run

First you need to install the dependencies. It is recommended to do it in a virtual environment. To do so, make sure `virtualenv` is installed (`pip install virtualenv`) and then create a virtual env in the project folder :
```
python -m venv venv
```
Then activate the virtual env. On Linux / macOS :
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Or on Windows :
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
Then, install dependencies by running :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
